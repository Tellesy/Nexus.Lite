    - To build as a WAR file:
      ./gradlew clean build -PpackagingType=war

3. Running the application:

    - Running the JAR:
      java -jar build/libs/nexus-middleware-lite-0.1.0.jar

    - Running the WAR:
      The WAR can be deployed to your preferred servlet container, or if using Spring Bootâ€™s embedded server, run:
      java -jar build/libs/nexus-middleware-lite-0.1.0.war

Configuration
-------------

Before running the application, update the application.yml file located in the src/main/resources directory with your database connection details and other configuration parameters.

Example application.yml:

spring:
application:
name: nexus-lite
datasource:
hikari:
jdbc-url:              <DATABASE-CONNECTION-STRING>
username:              <DB USER>
password:              <DB PASSWORD>
driver-class-name:     oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
maximum-pool-size:     10
minimum-idle:          2
connection-timeout:    19000
idle-timeout:          450000
max-lifetime:          800000
data-source-properties:
defaultRowPrefetch:          100
implicitCachingEnabled:      true
fastConnectionFailoverEnabled: true
implicitStatementCacheSize:  50

server:
port: 7003

logging:
level:
root: info

Replace <DATABASE-CONNECTION-STRING>, <DB USER>, and <DB PASSWORD> with your actual database details.

API Example
-----------

The application exposes endpoints to check the status of LYPay transactions. For example, to look up a transaction, send a POST request to:

POST /api/v1/transactions/lookup

Sample Request:

{
"userId": "SWITCHUSER",
"rrn": "123456789012",
"stan": "123456",
"txnAmt": "1000.00",
"termId": "123456",
"setlDate": "31-12-2023"
}

Sample Response:

{
"code": "R1",
"message": "Transaction is Failed",
"transactionType": "CREDIT"
}

Note: The actual response depends on the transaction details and its status.
